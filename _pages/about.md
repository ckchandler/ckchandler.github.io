**I'm in progress :)**

Hey I'm Chelsea! I am a 4th year PhD student at CU Boulder in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) and the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.colorado.edu/ics/). I recieved my B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) in 2016, completed my M.S. in Computer Science at CU Boulder in 2020, and expect to finish my Ph.D. in Spring 2022.

My research uses computational methods (re: natural language processing and machine learning) to analyze the language and behavior of people with mental illness. In a world where mobile health is becoming increasingly important (*\*cough\** COVID-19), this sort of approach allows patients who can't get in to see a clinician to be monitored remotely, frequently, and accurately. 

Last year I had a cool opportunity to be interviewed by both [Denver7 News](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/cu-boulder-artificial-intelligence-app-could-change-the-way-mental-illness-is-diagnosed) and [Newsy](https://www.newsy.com/stories/how-an-ai-phone-app-could-help-patients-with-schizophrenia/) about my research.
