I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder developing and validating computational language and speech based tools for the detection of neurocognitive disorders. I am interested in the creation of ethical and transparent AI methods that harness explainability and computational safeguards. I am incorporating aspects of participatory design for the creation of human-in-the-loop enabled interfaces for clinical decision making. 

I recieved a joint PhD in Spring 2022 from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) and the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.colorado.edu/ics/) at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by [Peter Foltz](http://peterfoltz.me/) and [Jim Martin](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/). I recieved a BA in Math and Computer Science at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) in 2016, and a MS in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2020.

In April 2021 I participated in a [LSU Science Cafe discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdOTjm9Xjk&ab_channel=LSUResearch) entitled The Doctor Is In (Your Phone): How digital technologies can help treat serious mental illness. Last year I had a great opportunity to be interviewed by [Denver7 News](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/cu-boulder-artificial-intelligence-app-could-change-the-way-mental-illness-is-diagnosed) and [Newsy](https://www.newsy.com/stories/how-an-ai-phone-app-could-help-patients-with-schizophrenia/) about my research!
