I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder developing AI and natural language processing (NLP) methods to support collaborative learning and student communication in the classroom. My work focuses on creating transparent and generalizable language technologies for analyzing student discourse, with applications in real-time feedback and classroom analytics. I am interested in mitigating algorithmic bias and enhancing model generalizability across diverse educational contexts.

I continue to explore the topic of my PhD dissertation - the intersections between AI and mental health, particularly through speech-based machine learning models for understanding neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. My approach integrates principles of explainable AI and human-centered design, with the goal of building ethical, actionable tools for use in clinical settings.

I received a joint PhD in Spring 2022 from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) and the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.colorado.edu/ics/) at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by [Peter Foltz](http://peterfoltz.me/) and [Jim Martin](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/). I received a BA in Math and Computer Science at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) in 2016, and a MS in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2020.

In April 2021 I participated in a [LSU Science Cafe discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdOTjm9Xjk&ab_channel=LSUResearch) entitled The Doctor Is In (Your Phone): How digital technologies can help treat serious mental illness. In 2020 I had the opportunity to be interviewed by [Denver7 News](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/cu-boulder-artificial-intelligence-app-could-change-the-way-mental-illness-is-diagnosed) and [Newsy](https://www.newsy.com/stories/how-an-ai-phone-app-could-help-patients-with-schizophrenia/) about my research!
