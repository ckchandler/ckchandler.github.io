Research
======
### Marymount University
* Computational Psychiatry (April 2019 - Present)
  * Developed a pipeline to extract Natural Language Processing features from psychiatric speech data
  * Implemented machine learning models based on language features to characterize Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease

### University of Colorado Boulder
* Educational AI (Fall 2020 - Present)
  * Extracted BERT sentence embeddings of student speech transcripts for use in an AI tutoring system
  * Fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model for use in a novel AI tutoring system
* Word Embedding API/Website (Fall 2019)
  * Built an API for generating word embedding similarity measures between pieces of text using Python
  * Input text was preprocessed, converted to LSA or Word2Vec embeddings, and cosine distances between various segments of the text were generated
  * Developed the final user facing website using HTML and JavaScript
* Computational Psychiatry (Summer 2018 & 2019)
  * Collected immediate and delayed verbal recalls to short stories from mentally ill and presumed healthy study participants
  * Extracted surface level and semantic features from verbal recalls to build machine learning models for predicting human ratings of recall content and classifying participants as mentally ill or healthy
  * Modeled speech and language features to predict self-reports of emotion
